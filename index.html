            <p>I am here to tell you a story of how my dog Chud (pictured left) and I began our photojournalism endeavors as a team.  I discovered that Chud had 
              incredibly high emotional intelligence at a young age, and I started noticing this quality in other dogs as well.  Chud and I have our own language
              we use to communicate and I was interested in interviewing other dogs and their owners in order to document this phenomenon!  Another focus of our
              project is the specific talents and jobs that dogs have in their every day lives and how these coincide with their owners.

            <div class="d-flex col">
              <p>What we've discovered is that the relationship between dog and owner actually alters the personality of both parties.  As one's relationship 
                with their dog develops, both the personality of the dog and the human change and grow together to become similar beings.  Traits of one can 
                be seen in the other, and a sophisticated working relationship develops.  We've spent the past 6 months focusing on the relationships of 6 
                different owner/dog pairs and documenting our findings.
